    <h2>June 5, 2020</h2>
      <p>It all started as an experiment. Tyler watched a video on farming in India, and discovered a technique to retain water in extreme drought.</p>
      <img src="../images/potato1.jpg" class="regular-image">
      <p>Depth is 1 foot down and the berries are two feet high. We mixed potting soil with the regular soil of the earth.
          As far as we understand, water is retained in ground better by lowering the level of ground and raising barrier on three sides so that the water is directed to the said area.</p>

        <p>Itâ€™s been about a week or so and we started seeing the potatoes sprouting. They grow really fast.</p>
      <h2>June 18, 2020</h2>
        <img src="../images/potato4.jpg" class="regular-image">
        <p>Potatoes on the right half of the farm started growing.</p>
      <h2>June 22, 2020</h2>
        <img src="../images/potato5.jpg" class="regular-image">
        <p>Plants are growing fast but there have been signs of native wildlife munching on the leaves.</p>
      <h2>June 24, 2020</h2>
        <img src="../images/potato6.jpg" class="regular-image">
        <p>Very bad news. We found out this morning that rabbits or some kind of wildlife raided our potato farm. They ate the two largest ones on the left side. Hopefully with time the potatoes will resprout. We will take precautionary measures from now on to make sure this will not happen again.</p>
