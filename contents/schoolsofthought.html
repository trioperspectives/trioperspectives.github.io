      <p class="universal-writing">In a world where just about everything can be explained using science,
        we tend to disagree about things quite a bit. Every topic from politics,
         to philosophy and religion, and even science itself (to some degree) has
         some disagreement actively being disputed. This wouldn’t be so weird by
         itself, as no person can see the truth perfectly clearly, and thus different
         people have different perceptions of what the truth is especially when it comes
         to things that aren’t a predictable science. </p>
      <img src="../images/argument-silhouette.jpg" class="regular-image">
      <p class="universal-writing">However, this, very often, is not the case; most of the time, rather than arguments
        between people with a mostly similar understanding, most arguments happen between
        people on vastly different sides of an issue</p>
